-- Indexes and constraints the Prisma schema cannot express.
--
-- `prisma migrate diff` only knows what is in the .prisma files, so anything
-- here is invisible to it and gets dropped from every generated migration.
-- scripts/new-migration.sh strips those DROPs and re-appends this file, so the
-- statements below are the single source of truth for them.
--
-- Everything here is idempotent: the file is replayed by every migration.

-- Circl Intelligence matches guides to a draft request in under 400ms while a
-- member waits to post (1.6.5), and every `q` filter in the spec searches a
-- title and a body. Trigram GIN turns those ILIKEs from sequential scans into
-- index scans, which matters at 100,000 rows and not at 100.
